Methodological summary: from concept to database PDF

Problem framing & scoping. We formalized the “work-for-lodging” idea into data requirements (actors, processes, compliance and payroll constraints) and set clear modeling boundaries.

Domain decomposition. The system was partitioned into three coherent domains—(A) People/Accommodation/Payroll, (B) Projects/Work/Timesheets, (C) Documentation/Media—to reduce cognitive load and keep diagrams readable.

Logical data modeling. For each domain we defined entities, primary/foreign keys, attributes, and constraints; captured cardinalities (1..1, 1..*, n:m via junction tables), and encoded special semantics (e.g., XOR between task_id and shift_id, “one active lodging agreement”).

Notation & conventions. We fixed naming (UPPER_SNAKE for tables, snake_case for attributes), color coding per domain, and a compact legend so the diagrams remain self-describing.

Documentation structure. We added an executive summary (process narrative), per-panel notes for rules/assumptions, and later an appendix with parameterized payroll examples and legal pointers.

Diagram synthesis in LaTeX/TikZ. We implemented reusable TikZ styles (entity/junction/edges, cardinality labels), used pdflscape for landscape pages and adjustbox to scale to page, with tcolorbox for notes placed below each figure.

Robust typesetting choices. We compiled with pdfLaTeX; handled underscores safely (underscore package); standardized assets via a \safeinclude{...} wrapper (prefers PDF/PNG/JPG) to avoid SVG/AVIF pitfalls; improved readability with microtype and compact lists (enumitem).

Front matter. A cover page was produced via two minipages for partner logos and standardized title metadata.

Validation loop. We iteratively compiled, resolved syntax/asset issues, and checked referential integrity and constraints against the narrative until the PDF matched the model.

Reusability. The template (styles, legend, page layout) is domain-agnostic: replace entities/attributes and regenerate to apply the workflow to new projects.
